==== Todo =================================================================
- replace iemguis with guis of my own making
==== BUGS =================================================================
- It's really bad to have to update the file path for the tcl plugin to load the themes.
  - Let's fix this in future versions. Have the plugin be a part of the tcl that comes
    with my version of pd.
- radios leave behind inlets when deleted, or when snd and rcv are added
  - doesn't matter, I'm removing iemguis anyways.
==== Improvements =========================================================
- have an easy way to add themes?
- move the theming options into a better menu
- create a preferences menu where all preferences are set, rather than
  scattered all over the place
