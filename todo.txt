==== Todo =================================================================
- themes dialog
  - later figure out what to do with the theme state toggle
  - leaving dark mode buttons alone for now.
  - decide what to do about pd dialog themeing vs. pd patch theming
- pdwindow needs some help
- min width of box needs to change if inlets are overlapping?
  - this is annoying and causes strange issues with hitbox, and t_linetraverser
  - it would be better if objects knew what their width was inherently instead of
    having to calculate it all the time.
- replace iemguis with guis of my own making
==== BUGS =================================================================
- radios leave behind inlets when deleted, or when snd and rcv are added
  - doesn't matter, I'm removing iemguis anyways.
==== Improvements =========================================================
- have an easy way to add themes?
- move the theming options into a better menu
- create a preferences menu where all preferences are set, rather than
  scattered all over the place
