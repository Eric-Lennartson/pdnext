=== BUGS =================================================================
- radios leave behind inlets when deleted, or when snd and rcv are added
=== Improvements =========================================================
- have an easy way to add themes?
- have iemgui's update colors based on themes
- move the theming options into a better menu
- create a preferences menu where all preferences are set, rather than
  scattered all over the place
- change cursor for inlet hovering to be the one that purr data uses.
